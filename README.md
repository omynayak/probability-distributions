# Probability Distributions in C++

## What is it
- A set of implementations of various functions that compute the probabilities of various discrete and continuous distributions.

## Why did I make it?
- Because fun is in writing mathematical logic from scratch. This project only uses the cmath library (which could count as cheating sort of) but makes use of basic formulae and mathematical manipulations to compute probabilities.
